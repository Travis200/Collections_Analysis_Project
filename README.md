# README
This application compares the performance speeds of different collections (ArrayDirectory, ArrayListDirectory, or 
HashMapDirectory) by writing data to a CSV file and writing a text file called "performance_report.txt" that compares
the performance speeds for the different directories.
The application provides a command line interface where the user can choose to either use a CSV file for the data to 
test or manually input the data. Whichever option the user chooses, they will then be given an option for
ArrayDirectory, ArrayListDirectory, or HashMapDirectory to process the data.
The data is output to write_data.csv in the form of a CSV file.
This is data returned is also returned in an ASCII table.
